# BGL

BGL is a lofi beat generator hence the name (Beat Generator Lofi)

The current version of this project can be found at https://braventstein-bgl-v1.netlify.app/

This project is planned to be fully finished in june of 2021

after this project bravenstein (the creator) is planning on making a different generator for a different genre of music

# How i did this in simple terms

So there have been multiple projects that helped contribte to this, one of the main ones is tonaljs // https://www.npmjs.com/package/tonal // they have set up a functional javascript music theory library

This is used to help generate the progressions, patterns, and others.

Another project that plays a huge role in BGL is a google project known as magenta // https://magenta.tensorflow.org/ // if you want to learn exactly what magenta does check out their website. But the quick version is that they use machine learning to help make music.

Majenta is used in this project to help generate the melody, as well as the drums.

Other than that the project is mostly the web-app code and the different samples that the music is generated from.


This was made for people like rippl who were genuinely curious how this was made but are unable to make sense of the source code or how this all works.

If you want to get into more detail about how these different projects are used, I reccomend you try and look at the source code as it is all here on github, as well as all of the projects that helped me make this projects source codes. links to the github pages will be below.

# How the website was made

// https://bgl.netlify.app/ // 

This project was bootstrapped in a facebook project known as Create React App // https://create-react-app.dev/ // This allows me to easily run the command " NPM build" in the project directory and have it make a working webapp.
Once you have the build folder the command generated I went to Netlify // https://www.netlify.com/ //

Once you are at Netlify it is as easy as drag and drop literally.
